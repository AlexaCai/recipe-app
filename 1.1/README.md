## Project description

This Recipe app has been created to help users plan their next meals. Users can create and modify recipes with ingredients and cooking time, which then display a difficulty parameter automatically calculated by the app. Users can also search for recipes by their ingredients.

This project is separated in two parts: 

**1-** A command line application for the Recipe app, which is able to create, read, and modify recipes, as well as searching for recipes based on ingredients.

**2-** A web application using the Django framework, built on the first deliverable (command line application) to deliver a more user-friendly UI for the recipe app. 

**The current repository and README concerns the first part (command line application).** To see the second part related to Django, please visit the [following repository](placeholer).

## User interface

Since all input and output takes place on a command line for this first part of the project, the UI is limited in terms of presentation. Below is an image of what it looks like.

## Technical aspects (overview)

The Recipe app works on Python 3.6+ installations and is connected to a MySQL database locally hosted.


## Technical aspects (development)

This section presents the development process of the command line application, step by step.

### Step 1

**1.1 â€“ Python installation**

First open the Command Prompt, and type `python --version`. This allows to see if Python is already installed on the machine or not. If this command returns `python X.X.X` (version number), it means Python is already installed.  Note that a Python 3.8.x or 3.9.x version is required.

If Python is not installed, head over  [download version 3.8.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387/) from Python official website and click on **Windows Installer** according to your system version (32-bit or 64-bit). Once downloaded, open the file and follow the installation instructions. 

**1.2 - Virtual environment creation**

Install the *virtualenvwrapper* package via the Command Prompt. For Windows users, this is done by running `pip install virtualenvwrapper-win`. Then,  create a new virtual environment by running the command `mkvirtualenv <the name you want>` (**see point A in image below**).

**1.3 - First Python file creation** 

Still on the Command Prompt, move (cd) to the directory in which you want the Python code files to be located, and run `code .` (**see point B in image below**). This will open Visual Code Studio, and allow creating a python file and start writing codes. Once the codes are written, save the file.

**1.4 - Running the Python code file**

Still on the Command Prompt (and in the folder path where the Python file  has been saved), run the command `python <script filename>` (**see point D in image below**). This will start the Python interpreter and asks it to run commands from the specified script file. The results of the codes will then be displayed in the Command Prompt.

**Note**: If the codes aren't rendering as supposed in step 1.4, it's possible to use the Python shell REPL running `python`, and write the codes line by line directly in it to see the output for each line (which is useful to try out syntax or quick debugging). **See point C in image below**.
